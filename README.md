# Process

In this document you can read all about my process.

## Design

For this design I wanted to create a sidebar to navigate to the items of the onepager. On the top of the page will be a picture/avatar of me with my name, age and profession next to it. On the page I will have 4 sections: Who am I?, My Music, My Location and Socials. All the socials have their own logo that I will use as icon in the side bar, but I also needed general icon for the socials. Therefore I made some sketches of icons that could represent the socials.

## Breakdown

To make sure I have a clear understanding of what I need to do, I made a breakdown of the website. The navigation bar will be on the left side of the page, but to make sure it's still semantic it will be in de header of the website. The header will also contain the avatar and the name, age and profession. In the main section of the website I will have 4 sections: Who am I?, My Music, My Location and Socials.

## Micro Interaction

For the project we need one or more micro interactions. For that I created a little sketch with an idea for the menu buttons.

## Node.js, Express and EJS

To make my website dynamic I needed to create a server with Node.js. Bas helped me out with setting this up. I've done it before with block tech but that was a while ago so it was good for me to follow his workshop. We used express as framework and EJS as template engine.

### Spotify

With this server I wanted to make use of the Spotify Web API.
